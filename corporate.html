      <h3>Justification</h3>
      <p>My name is Gergana Kircheva and this website is part of a redo related to PRJ4 back from my Year 2. As negotiated, the website is being done without participating in a group.</br>
        The homepage starts with a navigation bar where the website visitor can find all the pages. Below it is the centered logo of the company with a button leading to a quiz that Mingle uses 
        in order to match the couples for their trips. After that, on the home page can be found examples of the destinations the company provides trips to. Testimonials from satisfied customers
        follow the destinations section of the home page. In the footer quick links to the socials of the brand are located.</br>
        In order to adjust the website based on the new project brief, in particular the fundraiser part, a “Support us!” page was added, where gold, silver and bronze tier are shown, 
        depending on the price the person is willing to donate. Each tier comes with specific benefits the donator gets in relation to their trip provided by Mingle. Below the tiers a form 
        through which people can donate is located.</br>In the contact page links towards the socials are found, together with a contact form and a map, showing the location of the Mingle office.

      </div>
      <h3>Design Choices</h3>
      <p>Two fonts were used throughout the website-“Dancing script” for the logo and the headers, and “Roboto” for the main text as it is easy to read and has a good contrast when compared to the cursive headers.
        <br/> The original brand color scheme was reused in this website.

      <h3>User Testing Report </h3>
      <div class="testing row">
      <p class="testing-text col-8">Since this is a redo related sonly to the coding part of this Production House Project, the same user testing report is used as from the initial website back in Year 2 (2019-2020).
      <br/>
      During the interviews for Lean Canvas we did not have the website running yet, so we have decided to show the “users” wireframes, color scheme and flow diagram of our website and ask them questions from those.
      <br/>
      *on the right is an image that we showed during the interviews
      <br/>

      We have interviewed 20 potential users. The users liked our design and layout. We also gathered some recommendations on what to change. The most mentioned one was to add user reviews to the page, to show the potential customers what the satisfied customers think. Therefore we have added testimonials to the homepage. We were also told that it would be appreciated for the quiz to be on the main page, as it engages you with the company right away.
      <br/>
      Later during the creation of the website we used our own team to look through each other's work and provide feedback on any issues we saw.
